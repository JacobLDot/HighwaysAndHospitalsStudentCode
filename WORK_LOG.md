| September 12 |   2-2:35    | I'm thinking about how to find which highways dont connect to each other which will find the clusters. So apparently I was looking online through a bunch of node connection algorithms, and I found an algorithm called Prim's algorithm and Kruskal's algorithm, which both seem like they fit for the problem set, so I was thinking about how I would implement Prim's algorithm into my code during this work block. |

Basically I just want to go through every connected component in the most efficient path I think. |
