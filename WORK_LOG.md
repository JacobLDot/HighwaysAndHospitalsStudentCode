So apparently I was looking online through a bunch of node connection algorithms, and I found an algorithm called Prim's algorithm and Kruskal's algorithm, which both seem like they fit for the problem set, so I was thinking about how I would implement Prim's algorithm into my code during this work block. |

Basically I just want to go through every connected component in the most efficient path I think. |

| September 22 | 3:15-4:15 & 6:30-7:20 | My thinking evolved from focusing on using BFS for exploring clusters to realizing that Union find is more efficient and will lead to a faster runtime. Keeping track of roots for each node and merging them together using the compressions and union will make it faster run with larger data, so I switched to the algorithm that we went over during class. I got stuck on a part where the test results were missing a few values, so I had to troubleshoot for a while. My thinking evolved from initially using queues and linked lists to manage visited and unvisited nodes to finding parents of each roots and keeping track of each clusters root and size, which is vital to determining the ultimate cost of the highways and hospitals. |
